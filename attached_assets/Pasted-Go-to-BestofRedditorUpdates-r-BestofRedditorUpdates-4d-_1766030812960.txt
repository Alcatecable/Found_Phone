Original Post: September 16, 2025

I don't know what to do. The title pretty much explains it all. I am a SAHD of 3, including one with special needs. For the past couple years it's been a slog... therapist after therapist after therapist for my kiddo with cerebral palsy, 2 other kids in school, it's something we discussed many times. She works and is able to provide for us financially and I would stay at home with them.

2 years ago she joined a gym and began a relationship with "John." John and my wife would frequently message on Facebook about random things, but things that my wife tried to hide and delete. She has lied about speaking to him, what they've spoken about, amongst other things. We are done having kids so she used this time to get a breast aug and "tummy tuck" like procedure. It felt like she was literally going to cheat on me, but she assured that this was just her way of getting out of her "motherhood" body.

She spends an unworldly amount of time at the gym. Before work, off days. Literally doesn't stop. She can easily spend 3-4 hours at the gym. Meanwhile I am at home with the kids, preparing lunch, breakfast, getting them to school, taking my child with cerebral palsy to his therapy appointments.

Things start to get worse.. I find that I am getting more frustrated with feeling like a single parent while she is just living her "dream" life at the gym and building a career. She feels that I'm treating her unfairly and takes her rings off last summer. She didn't tell me about it, but she is stating that we are "separated," but no ground rules are laid out.. she continues to live her life with her rings off without any sort of discussion. We were definitely in a slump.

My skepticism of her and John's relationship continues, but we hit hills and valleys in our relationship. It feels that sometimes it improves, and some days it feels that it wasn't going to work.

We had laid out some rules about this guy, and I asked her to delete him from her phone and block him... they can communicate at the gym since she's there so much but no where else.

Flash forward to June, I found a text message thread while I tried fixing her phone with a random number. It was messages upon messages of her's and John's relationship, mind you, this guy is married as well.

My suspicions for over 2 years was true.. I knew she was cheating on me. I fucking flipped. I was so upset. She said they didn't have any physical contact except for holding hands and hugging... she was extremely adamant that that was it.

Things didn't feel like they would get better... But eventually... they kind of did over a couple months... that or maybe I was missing who my wife was. I don't know but it felt that an emotional affair was easier to forgive. I told her I forgave her and that we recommitted to making this work. It felt that we were more normal than ever, and she was being open and honest about my questions that I had.

The day after our anniversary, she drops a bombshell.. she actually was physical in her affair. They had sex an unknown amount of times in his car while she was at work. She says they wore a condom. I am so fucking mortified. I already grieved for her once but now I put through another round of mental torment and physical PTSD. She lied AGAIN. She said she didn't have sex with him initially but now she wanted to lay it out.

She says the last time they had sex was in April. I don't know what to believe. She says she felt insanely lonely. I asked her why not just get a divorce, and she said that she never had that intention and that she "cares so deeply for our family and kids." It feels so contradictory. She had sex with this guy while also having sex with me occasionally. And she didn't feel the need to tell me that I'm literally banging her after this guy was. Jesus Christ, typing this makes me want to die.

I am using an alt account, but I have details that would make this story more clearer but I do not want to tie it in to some personal information as I think I would be pretty easily identified by my profession and personal posts.

She states she is utterly remorseful and wants to work things out. I literally just got myself tested for STDs today.. I would have never thought I would have to do this, but here I am.

I am at a lost guys. I am a mid-thirties dad of 3 and it feels that my life is fucking over. My kids keep me grounded.

Relevant Comments

Commenter 1:

"cares so deeply for our family and kids."

3-4 hours at the gym every day?

When is she even home to care "so deeply" about the kids?

OOP: This is exactly my point! She literally goes to the gym in the early morning, but sometimes doesn't get home until kids are on the bus. I would hate to miss waving them off, I wave them off every morning.

OOP responds to a longer comment regarding getting an appointment with a lawyer and marriage counselor. Does OOP want to reconcile and if his wife was picking John over him many times

OOP: I am reading through this. I will add. When I found said text messages, the first thing she said was "she cares about him" which really pissed me off. She should care about me as her husband. She finally has told him no more contact and she blocked him on every platform and said that she is willing to have an "open device" policy.

I do think this is extremely remorseful, at least right now. He has made some... suggestive comments.. as a way to make her feel bad. She did put her rings back on and the guy wants to reconcile to me as well.. aka he reached out to me on Instagram and I immediately blocked his dumbass.

Commenter 2: I've said before on this sub that if my spouse was the one to come clean about an affair I'd be likely to try to work it out but this is just...this is just a disaster.

If you decide to stay, and that's a big if

Couple's counseling.

Quitting the gym.

Spending time her newly available free time with the kids she allegedly cares deeply for.

But this all hinges on one question: do you even want to work things out? Seriously, ignore everything I just suggested. Ignore any stay, leave, crucify her in the divorce, or other comments. Take some time and really ask yourself: do you want to try to work this out?

Commenter 3: Thank you for putting the question into words that I’ve been trying to do myself in another thread. The real question is, what is she doing to want to make him stay?

OOP: That's what I'm thinking. From the beginning I'm convinced she had a plan or deep intention, but she says things just kind of "fell" that way. Yeah right. She says they were just friends first but if that's the case why did she delete all of her messages from him when I first saw them? (that first happened like 1.5 years ago) this has been shitty since the start.

Commenter 4: Your mistake was thinking any sort of affair would be less harmfully. An affair is an affair (regardless getting physical or not).

Have you wondered why did she have this "surge of honesty" so suddenly?

I imagine her affair has gone sour, she's afraid being dumped by you and is trying to keep you around.

I won't be the one who tell you how you should take on your life, OP. You are the only one who knows how hard this hurt you and how bad you are now. However, I'd recommend you to take your feelings in consideration this time.

May you find the inner strength to take the best decision for your happiness and for your emotional health.

OOP: You're not wrong, things did get sour after I found these texts. She immediately ceased that relationship and blocked him. I think that's why she wants to "start fresh" and continue our relationship..

She is giving me contradictory information that it only happened because she was separated and she was extremely lonely, but then said she doesn't want to leave her family and that we mean so much to her. I asked her plainly "did you think about us when you were banging in his car?"

 

Update: December 7, 2025 (nearly three months later)

MILD UPDATE: My wife of 13 years confessed about an affair about 3 months ago, she told me the day after our anniversary that they had sex often.

I debated on whether or not I really wanted to write an update or not.

Life has been really a whirlwind of emotion since that point. For all those people who gave me encouragement and advice, I really appreciate you more than you know. We sought counseling pretty much ASAP since all this shook out which has been a somewhat positive experience, I think for both of us. Overall this update is really fucking boring, but maybe I need an outlet right now because I'm feeling it hard today.

Generally speaking, things just "are" right now. Some days feel more hopeful than others, but we are decently committed to making this work for now, especially given our situation with our kids, specifically our son.

Our therapy sessions tend to work on our communication and forward progress. It's hard not to gripe or look for some sort of validation of my frustrations with my wife about how things shook out or what I experienced. Although, she is entitled to her feelings about how I approached their relationship in the beginning (which she swears was merely "friendly" in the beginning.)

Although the more I think about it, the more it feels like I'm being gaslight by my wife and maybe a little bit by our therapist. I generally do not have a problem with my wife having male friends, and even when we were having a hard time, I felt that I made my boundary extremely clear. Initially when they were just "friends" she would message him like.. regularly, going into topics that felt boundary-crossing. In this, she says they were just friends. But now, I don't think I'm comfortable with her having "friends" like that again. And I told her that. I am a little upset because reflecting on things now makes me feel like both my wife and our therapist made it seem I'm letting my anxiety get the best of me.

We have moved toward an open device policy.. really on her end. We have set new boundaries about relationships and maintaining these relationships.

Although now that I read and type this out, I really feel like I'm giving more than what she ever had to, even though she's the one who decided to pursue a runaway relationship with another man. She states she didn't feel safe in our marriage and pursued this relationship. I'm so conflicted on how to feel about everything as I type this. I am learning to rebuild my trust in her. I need to feel safe again. I want to feel like this was her character flaw rather than a reaction to how she felt I treated her. She says she felt unsafe, frustrated, unloved. I am not saying those things aren't untrue because she is entitled to her own feelings, but it feels like an excuse.

Things were rocky for a while, but she feels that we were not doing well before I had issues with her communication with this guy. That feels incorrect, because since that moment I know I've been short with her and with good reason, she literally lied about the amount of communication they had together. It feels like I'm being gaslit because she made it seem like friends have that regular amount of communication.

Some days we end in fights, mainly about my tone or my reaction. It feels like a broken record.. she constantly criticizes how I communicate with her or our kids. It feels like it never ends and this is something she continually goes back to as a reason for her abandonment. But some days, it feels like it ends more peacefully and calmly.

I guess going back to why I decided to write today was really about feeling fucking worthless. I feel absolutely unfit and unworthy. I let my wife trample on me, and she makes me feel that it really was "my fault" for her actions. It feels that the therapist also wants me to understand these flaws and how they shaped the events that happen. I don't know, but maybe the therapist is right. I am noticeably anxious about anything my wife does.. and I feel that it won't change. I will always worry about who she's talking to.

She says she's committed to our relationship, but it feels like such a shitty excuse. I told her that's what you said on our wedding day, and look at this fucking mess.

I wish my update contained more substance. I wish part of me could say I left her cheating ass, got alimony/child support, got abs, and met someone new. I can't do that right now. I try to stay busy at work and at home.

EDIT: Just for clarity's sake, my wife did make it abundantly clear that she wants nothing to do with him, in more ways than one. He's been finding ways to continue to see her attention. He even wrote an email to her, and she showed me immediately.

Relevant Comments

Commenter 1: I’m sorry dude.

I guess you decided to stay. I know I wouldn’t. It’s easier said than done, yes, but she lied, lied, and lied. I’m sure there’s more lies in there too.

OOP: My decision to stay isn't set it stone. It's built on the idea that we are extremely fragile and she has to put in the work. If not or if she crosses our transparent boundary, I'm not giving her a third chance.

Commenter 2: I’m curious have you informed his wife? Has she cut contact with him? Dose she still go to the gym? What’s is she doing to make this work on her end. Please elaborate I’m genuinely curious. I would like to know how you’re going to be able to move forward in this. I’m sorry you going through this. UpdateMe!

OOP: As far as I know, he and his wife are separated and made that an agreement. So to him and his wife, he was within his own rights. That's all hearsay though, and I'd rather not think about it anymore.

Does my wife go to the gym? Buddy, let me tell you.. she's still addicted to it. Goes every day in the AM since me and our kids are still sleeping. Still works out for 3-4 hours at a time usually. Although she is quite social when she goes which is why it takes her so long. She finds that her identify really relies on her ability to maintain this gym time I've noticed. I think if you took it away from her, I don't know what she would do.

Commenter 2: Fine I can understand that (gym) but is it the same gym? Like is this just business as usual? They still attend the gym together? Please I hope not. You can’t be that naïve. There has to be some consequences at least in my experience. If nothing changes nothing changes. What has she done exactly in this reconciliation to prove to you that you’re not her 2nd choice?

OOP: It is NOT the same gym. Although it's funny when she bitches about not being able to go there (mainly because of her old friend group and proximity to our house), it makes me want to stare at her and laugh as if she didn't cause that entire problem.

Commenter 3: Fire your therapist - whoever they are - they suck! You need to find one specialising in infidelity who will hold her feet to the fire.

Unless your therapist holds the line that no matter what was going in the marriage, cheating is inexcusable, and that the first priority is to deal with YOUR pain and the nuclear bomb that your wife CHOSE to blow up in the middle of your marriage - they’re crap and completely unqualified to do their job…

Good luck!

OOP: She has tried EMDR therapy for my trauma, I believe they are qualified at least somewhat, but I wish she would be more assertive about protecting me given what transpired. Although to that effect, I know she needs to remain neutral so I'm not sure what "good" therapy looks like.

Commenter 4: Find a new couples therapist because yours sounds very biased. And, I REALLY suggest individual therapy because you need a space AWAY FROM HER to work through this.

OOP: I agree I think individual therapy would really help me.

Commenter 5: Never ever be a SAHD, women lose all respect for their spouses when they become SAHDs. Get a job pronto.

OOP: I have said this ad nauseam.. I have a PRN job! My special needs son has plethora of therapists he sees. He needs some type of stable transportation..

(editor's note: PRN = pro re nata meaning "as needed", an individual is called upon to work when needed, typically for a few hours of flexible shift work)

 

Self Esteem repair following affair: December 7, 2025 (same day, different subreddit)

Self Esteem repair following affair

My wife of 13 years cheated on me. We have been seeking counseling and trying to work through it. Although today I am realizing that I have literally no self-esteem anymore. She works out constantly while I am a stay at home parent and it shows. Without going into my past (or if you need context you can go into my post history), how do you begin to love yourself again especially since I have decided to stay?

Here's my theory: she's desperate to work things out with her husband because if they divorce, she might actually have to be a parent for once......and to a special needs child.

Don’t forget having to pay alimony too. Plus paying for potential child care if they have 50/50 custody or something that would interfere with work or her gym addiction.

If she convinces him to stay she gets child care, her money, and gets laid by her gym bf when she gets the itch

Yep. My friend and his wife got divorced several years ago. He was a SAH dad to their two special-needs children, and she cheated. After the divorce, she paid him alimony, bought him a new house, and hired a nanny to take care of the children during her (50/50) parenting time. The nanny did everything during the mom’s weeks: scouting meetings, school fundraisers, errands. The dad still attended all the kids’ events and threw their birthday parties after he returned to full time work. I know most of the parents of my kids’ classmates. I couldn’t pick this mom out of a lineup.

I knew a woman who had one child who was cared for by a nanny. She worked long hours in banking and finance, and she spent most weekends away from home doing whatever it took to avoid her kid.

I was an SAHM, and whenever she saw me, she'd commiserate with me about what a slog caring for little ones could be. Smdh

I’m a mom who is also the breadwinner and I admit I work too much and my husband has given me grief over it, but I don’t take calls after 6pm or on weekends unless it’s an emergency. I get some shit at work for it but I’m not robbing myself of that time with my child and I cannot comprehend not wanting to spend time with her. There’s been a couple of times where I was mentally fried and just tapped out and I just sat and watched her play with my husband but I wasn’t on my phone or anything I was just enjoying not being an active participant in a conversation for the first time all day.

Same! I’m a mom who has played both roles. I stayed at home when the kids are little and work now. But while I was in grad school, I sometimes just smiled watching our kids play Mario Kart with my husband/their dad. No better way to handle being mentally fried, imo.

When I was growing up, my mom stayed home with us. When she was tired but we were up in the morning, she'd come out to the living room sofa and doze there so she could keep half an eye on us.

My dad had as little to do with us as he could get away with. After their divorce, she openly referred to him as her 8th child.

My mom was the breadwinner and worked A LOT. Luckily she was remote when she wasn’t traveling to work with clients (which was pretty new at the time 25 years ago) and when she did travel, she made damn sure to be back to attend most of our sporting events and even was a scout leader in my younger years.

Just a wanted to let you know you’re doing a good job as a parent, and even though it’s a lot of work, your kids won’t forget it and it’s worth it.

Thanks, this is really good to hear! I’m the only woman in my family that works and it’s important to me that she understands that she has options in life but I don’t want me working to create resentment either.

I'm sure she would have gotten out of that responsibility as well, if she had been able to find a way to do it.

SAHD are rare, and this is with special needs kid. She will absolutely have to cough up alimony, probably lose the house (as that's the kids' residence). She likely has consulted a lawyer and been told.

She was checked out of the marriage, she stopped wearing her rings. She checked back in when she found what would happen,.

She’ll get slammed big time in child support and alimony too (if where they live has it). I wish OOP consulted an attorney.

Yes, this is THE issue in this story. It was crazy getting back together without making her spending more time with the kids and allowing OP to have a life as well

Swapping who goes to gym at those hours of gym going might be in order for them, lmalong woth cutting it to maybe half of time. Workout might do good for him, and his self esteem, and it would get her to be with kids, and ensure there are moments regurlarly when she pas all the responsibility if them, if those moments were missing.

Moreover, I’d start with a week of vacation for him alone. She will get to be the sole caretaker for a bit, get how hard it is, rethink what she has done (she doesn’t sound half remorseful as she should be) and maybe (maybe!) reconnect with her own children while he is clearing his mind and gets his thoughts together.

What, and furthermore, the fuck.
I think what you all are missing is she only stayed because this arrangement is so advantageous for her. If he insists on equal responsibilities she'll initiate the divorce herself. she didn't stay because she loves him, that's clear enough

Bingo, anyone eho works and then spends 3-4 hours at a Gym donsent care about their kids. I bet the resentment started after the one with special needs came along. Honestly super weak of this dude for even trying to work this out. She dosent care and shes hella toxic towards him. Also i bet when their kids are older they properly dosent even care about her since shes away for so long.

This guy should just leave. 2 things will happen, either they divorce and both struggle or she will eventually give him.full coustaty (english is not my first laungede).

Yeah but we know she wasn't really at the 'gym'. My cousin's husband was an awful cheat and before he got caught he was 'going to the park to watch the deer to clear his head' (10 min away by car) for four hours at a time. That guy could have reached enlightenment the amount of time he was spending clearing his head

Also, who the fuck socializes a ton at the gym? That is genuinely weirdo behaviour. Even when I’ve had good friends as my gym partner, our socialized didn’t add time to our workout, it was during our workout.

Someone going out of their way to talk to strangers enough that it adds hours to their gym time is such unusual behaviour. If she was a man, she’d likely have been kicked out for making people uncomfortable.

If she is actually at the gym, and not lying, then its just like those guys who spend two hours at the bar every day after work.  

Maybe they're alcoholics.  Or maybe they don't want to spend time with their families

Right?! I’m a SAHM. I cannot fathom my husband spending 3-4 hours at the gym much less myself. This dude needs to leave like yesterday. Let her pay child support and alimony at a rate that demonstrates she has little interest in being present. At least he’d be getting actual support from her at that point which is more than he’s getting right now.

I was a SAHD with an absent partner for the better part of a decade. There was always an excuse for her to stay an extra hour at work, or to have to rush off to handle some emergency in our extended family. She showed up for all the kids big things, the plays and concerts and holidays, but was never there for the day-to-day. I was so exhausted that I didn't have time to think, as I was slowly being socially isolated, and physically worn down from late nights with sick kids and early mornings getting them ready for school after she left for work.

That relationship ended a decade ago and I'm still emotionally burnt out and in recovery because of the lack of down time. I CPTSD because of someone who swore every day that they loved me and were gone all the time for our future.

It suuuuuuucks.

I don’t know how people lift seriously with kids, without having a home gym

If I spend more than 45min at the gym I run out of things to do. Now I'm not a gym rat, but I genuinely don't know what you'd do there for hours....daily.

Maybe if it's one that has a masseuse and sauna and other non-exercise amenities, but still.

I can't understand people who choose to stay.

The kids can probably see the cracks forming. The wife is just using him out of convenience.

The dude needs to divorce and get alimony. That's the solution to getting his self-esteem back: losing the dead weight that's dragging it down.

I agree, she is using him. One day it dawned on her how fkd up her life would be if he left. Having to pay child support and alimony, as well as managing co parenting whilst working FT with a special needs child. Her life would be a disaster. Nothing much would change for oop though, he's already pretty much a single parent.

And he's got a reasonable chance for full custody, I'd say, given her prolonged absences.

Poor chap. How can he regain his confidence in this shitty situation. His therapist seems biased towards the wife, which isn't terribly healthy. He's still being the stay at home parent. And she's using buzz phrases like "felt unsafe in the marriage" which are guaranteed to get therapists on your side.

As a woman, I normally have some sympathy with the female protagonists in these instances, but I'm all out with this one. She seems to lack any redeeming qualities.

He doesn't seem to realize that currently his highest achievable goal in his marriage is... to not be miserable.

I don't think he's even considering the possibility of achieving happiness, and is totally blind to that possibility... because subconsciously he knows he can't get there with his wife.

So sad. :(

She does not want OOP. We don't why but what she wants is OOP to run the household while she has meaningless affairs with whoever tickles her fancy. Her claims of not feeling safe are bullshit and a distraction.

OOP needs to realize that he cannot trust her because she is not worthy of trust, and this marriage cannot be saved, she has no actual interest in saving it. What she wants is her status quo, OOP taking care the kids while she openly cheats on OOP.

OOP needs to get the divorce and child support ASAP. That therapist is also useless, if i didn't know better i might think they approve of cheating or are an acquaintance of the wife.

I mean she said it herself, she cares about her family and kids. Family to her means she gets a husband to takes care of the kids and house while she does what she wants with a comfortable home taken care of. He needs to just divorce her, get alimony and childcare and let her do whatever.

His life would be better if he broke up with her and went 50/50 custody. Her free ride of daddy day care and 3 hours in the gym all day would be over.

It sounds like she told OOP simply to unburden herself. Not to be “honest.” Also sounds like she wants to “make the relationship work” because she realizes her life is a lot easier with a SAHD who takes care of everything at home while she works/cheats… as opposed doing the work of a SAHD and her current life.

He needs to start rebuilding his career asap and rebalance childcare between the two of them (and hired help for the special needs child) to give him the chance of starting over solo. Unless he’s absolutely sure she will be court ordered to financially support his life indefinitely, which I doubt will happen. He will have to earn a decent living at a certain point and the longer he waits the worse the chances of finding a job that will provide enough for his life and part time children’s needs.

Well, OOP is going to regret the choice to stay with her once she ends up negatively affecting those kids even more and they grow up and ask him, "Why didn't you just leave her, Dad?"

Staying with abusive manipulators when you have kids hurts the kids.

I'm sorry for this dude but she took her ring off, told him they were separated, then fucked another guy(s). He didn't get cheated on, he got left, he just can't accept it. She's still "trying to work it out" because he can't accept that it's over and divorce with kids is difficult, especially if one person isn't on board. So if she can be separated, fuck other guys, have op do the hard stuff and not deal with the mess of divorce, why wouldn't she? (Also does anyone else wonder if she actually is trying to work it out, or if that's just wishful thinking from op?)

OP will feel so much better if and when he moves on.

He's effectively already dead, and I dont do necromancy
Geez, this guy is a doormat. She treats him like shit, gaslights, him, lies over and over, fucks someone else, is likely still fucking someone else, and he just goes with it?

Dude needs to acquire some self-respect. I don't know if he's just terrified of the idea of finding a job to support himself, or if he really thinks she's going to change, but neither of those are going to end up working out for him.

I find it insane that after everything that’s happened to him, and others in a similar situation, people go to couples counselling. It’s like being shot and having to understand and take some responsibility for the motives of the person who shot you. It’s a nonsense. The relationship is over, he’s just choosing to stay in it.

OOP needs to see an individual therapist to help him decide what the best course of action is for him. The number of lies and gaslighting his wife did makes it nearly impossible to rebuild the trust. I don't think I'd be able to stay in his place.

It's purely his lack of self-esteem keeping him in this mess. She's legitimately made him feel like he can't do better.

They absolutely need a divorce. She hasn't changed. What the OOP doesn't know if whether the other guy has changed gyms.

She also needs to do some parenting. He doesn't have to be the only one dropping everything for their son. Maybe it's time for mom to do the same. He needs some sort of job, even if it's only part time. At least to start off with.

Anyone that ever recommends working things out in situations like these is full of it and has no self-love/respect; if you dont respect yourself why do you expect them to respect you? As soon as she said she had an affair either on the phone or person it should be over right there and then. Poor op, the only reason he has to stay is for his kids. But he would be happier divorced, with his kids, and feeling love by another woman. Staying will make him more miserable.... having to kiss or hug the cheating wife again ugn.

I feel for OOP. He’s confused.

She doesn’t like him. Obviously.

It’s cause he’s a chump in her eyes.

He thinks they should work it out for the kids! America should focus on marriage centric families. Not kid centric. Kids are better off with a single parent demonstrating good boundaries than witnessing two adults who don’t love each other.

His wife wanted out a long time ago and she is too weak to say it. But he’s to weak to end it.

Very sad all around.

You still can leave. It’s not a one-time decision and you have to stick to it forever. I hope he has his own therapist because if he doesn’t feel safe in couples therapy then why go.

Couples therapists seem like a bad idea for major issues. Their goal is to keep couples together at almost any cost because that’s a success story for them. The easiest way to do that is to present a united front with the abuser against their victim.

You can’t love yourself until you respect yourself. You can’t respect yourself until you take back your personal power from the person you gave it to. OOP won’t gain self-esteem until he files for divorce and starts moving forward.

This guy.. is desperately drinking the kool-aid in fear of what will happen if he accepts the fact his wife willingly betrayed him and still really doesnt care much for him..

And this BS "the guy is apparently seperated from his wife" was probably fed him from his lying wife in an attempt to do damage control.. OOP should reach out to the guys wife without his own wife knowing and inform her of the affair.

And.... MC after adultery almost always ends here - Therapist focusing on saving the marriage to the extent on helping the adulterer 'persuade' rugaweeping...

Just for clarity's sake, my wife did make it abundantly clear that she wants nothing to do with him, in more ways than one. 

besides some fucking, that is

Once she had that post-nut clarity of maybe having to pay OOP alimony and having the kids 50-50 she panicked! I bet

I doubt she can handle the kids half the time. So might as well let things "cool down", then do it again on the super down low

I don't know, maybe it's me but if my partner ever cheated on me, things we're done and dusted right there and then. Couples counseling? Nope, that's something that needs to happen before feeling like cheating on your partner

I agree. As soon as the kids are older she is gone. She doesn’t respect him at all. She only wants her family for the free baby sitting. If he leaves , her fun life is over.

He has a choice. Assuming they’re in a developed country, child support and alimony are there for this purpose. OOP would be better off. Right now she gets to spend only what’s absolutely necessary as it comes up, mostly for the children with nothing for OOP beyond keeping him alive. If they split then she has to pay a fixed amount based on her income for the kids, so there won’t be any “cheap” months. She’d also have to pay OOP a portion of her income as recognition for him having sacrificed his own career to be the kids’ primary carer, giving him his own small income. Both he and the kids would get the majority of her earnings between them. OOP would also get the house if it wasn’t solely hers before they got together. She’d be lucky if she could afford a gym membership afterwards.

Unless they’re living somewhere backwards as fuck it isn’t a better or safer option to stay with an emotionally abusive cheater.

 I have literally no self-esteem

since I have decided to stay?

I went through a divorce when neither of us had any self esteem. Luckily neither of us cheated, but we both had "desires" to cheat. After the divorce I was able to get my self esteem back from casual sex with women I thought were way out of my league until I realized they were in my league. She got her self esteem back and I have no desire to find out how.

4 years after our divorce we reconciled. We have been together again for a year and refer to ourselves as husband and wife.

If he ever gets his self esteem back the first thing he is going to do is leave her, but since he decided to stay he will end up feeling guilty or tearing his family apart and will be blamed for it.

Seriously this therapist sucks, OOP is in an abusive relationship and she's letting his abuser walk all over him in session.

I'm not religious but I am praying OP leaves her and has the most ruthless divorce lawyer. I also hope he tells the kids what she is doing is not acceptable.

Hell, the hubs should initiate the divorce since she admitted to cheating. Gonforbthebalimony, and child support. This will get him 50% of time to himself to build friendships, find hobbies for himself, and maybe a partner that he can trust. The mom deserves to feel all the pain possible, both emotionally and monetary.

Get a new therapist! Maybe take some time and think about what you really want out of this relationship and if you are getting that. Staying with someone who has been gaslighting you and essentially blaming her actions on you seems like a poor excuse for an affair. If one of your kids was in this situation what would your advice be to them.

I have a similar story. We didn't have kids and weren't married. There's more to it, but I decided it wasn't fair to me. The further away I get from it, the more I know it was true, especially the gaslighting. The similarities with his story are unparalleled

Bro deserves to divorce that pos and take her for every ounce possible. I don’t normally think that’s appropriate but it’s very clear she wants her cake and to eat it too.

I feel she ended her affair because she knows her husband can take her to the cleaners. And he SHOULD.

Anytime I need a reminder that we're only getting one half of the story, the OOP will slip in something like "She says she felt unsafe in our marriage. I can't say she's wrong" with no reflection or elaboration.

Well that's atrocious ! His wife is feeding him bullshit and he's eating it and he knows he's eating it . The only reason she's not getting a divorce is because she knows she would have to pay him enormous child support allowance to raise their children ,which she isn't willing to do . And to pay for independent child care for her children would cost even more . He's the cheapest option for her to continue her lifestyle ! John's still available and wants her . But though he's an ego boost she now knows he won't step up to the batting plate as a replacement partner (good enough as an affair partner but no good as a relationship partner) . But her narcissistic obsession with her appearance and gym time means she's still putting herself in the location and market for more cheating if OOP stays with her and forgives or forgets . In the long run it would be better for OOP to get a divorce and raise the kids on his own . After all he's already doing that while his wife screws him over as well as screwing Tom,Dick, Harry and John . Because OOP's right about one thing his wife and John targeted each other for an affair from the very start after they met .
