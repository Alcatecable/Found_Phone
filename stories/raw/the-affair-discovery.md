Scene 1: The Discovery
Wife: Hey, we need to talk
Wife: I need to tell you something
Wife: The day after our anniversary, there's something I've been hiding
OOP: What is it? You're scaring me
Wife: John... we weren't just friends
Wife: I lied to you
OOP: What do you mean lied?

Scene 2: The Confession
Wife: We had physical contact. Many times
Wife: In his car while I was at work
OOP: You're joking right?
Wife: I'm so sorry. I can't keep lying
Wife: I wasn't thinking clearly. I was so lonely
OOP: How many times?
Wife: I don't know... many times. We wore protection though

Scene 3: The Betrayal Deepens
John: Hey, I heard you told him everything
John: Why did you do that? We agreed to keep it private
Wife: I couldn't lie anymore. It wasn't fair to him
John: You're making a huge mistake. He's going to leave you
Wife: Maybe that's what I deserve
John: No, we can work this out. Tell him it was just once

Scene 4: The Contradiction
OOP: I found messages between you and John
OOP: He's telling you to lie to me about how many times
Wife: Those are old messages
OOP: From April? That's just a few months ago
Wife: I stopped seeing him after that
OOP: So you kept seeing him after June too?
Wife: I... I was confused

Scene 5: The Gaslighting
Wife: You don't understand how lonely I was
Wife: You were too focused on work. You weren't there for me
OOP: I was SAHD taking care of 3 kids including one with cerebral palsy
Wife: I know but emotionally I needed something
OOP: So you got it from a married man? How does that make sense?
Wife: I never wanted to hurt you
Wife: Maybe if you had been more present, this wouldn't have happened

Scene 6: The Unraveling
OOP: You got a breast augmentation and tummy tuck. For what?
Wife: Just for me
OOP: Or for John?
Wife: You're being unfair
OOP: You spent 3-4 hours at the gym every day
Wife: I needed that time
OOP: To see John?
Wife: No. Well... yes. But not the way you're thinking
OOP: What other way is there?

Scene 7: The Therapy Session
Wife: The therapist says I need to understand my feelings
Wife: I felt unsafe in our marriage
Wife: That's why I sought comfort elsewhere
OOP: Comfort? You betrayed me
Wife: I know and I'm sorry
Wife: But you have to understand what I was going through
OOP: What about what I'm going through?
Wife: I'm trying to work on us

Scene 8: The Reconciliation Attempt
Wife: I love you. I love our family
Wife: I put my rings back on. I'm committed to fixing this
OOP: Words mean nothing anymore
Wife: I blocked John on everything. Open device policy. I'm trying
OOP: You said that on our wedding day too
Wife: This is different
OOP: Is it though?
